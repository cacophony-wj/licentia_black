# Licentia

## "All I want to be is a badass comic book hottie who fucks and cuts heads."

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content, and you must be of legal age in your country (most Western countries: 18+, some Eastern ones: 21+)**.

_Licentia_ was one of _Wabbajack's_ oldest and most well-regarded adult modlists, featuring optional non-fetish content with the _OSuite_ series of _OStim_ mods and an emphasis on build variety, backed up by an accessible Power Fantasy design philosophy. It is now on hiatus due to the author's health difficulties. A replacement will soon arrive entitled _Licentia NEXT,_ watch for it.

### System Specifications

- intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 5 5000 or later
- NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER or AMD Radeon 5700 XT or later
- 40GB PAGEFILE, NO EXCEPTIONS

### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)

This account is mandatory.

## Installation

Before you do anything with _Wabbajack,_ ensure that _Skyrim_ is installed in a non-protected folder.

For _Wabbajack_ to match its files, _Skyrim_ needs to be set to the English language. 

_Licentia_ requires the additional _Creation Club Content_ from the _Skyrim Anniversary Edition Upgrade_. 

Ensure you have set antivirus exceptions for this folder, the _Skyrim_ vanilla game folder, and the _Wabbajack_ folder, or the installation will fail.

Ensure that _OneDrive_ is uninstalled.

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required. Download the x64 version of "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

You must set your Advanced Memory Pagefile to at least 40GB or the modlist will constantly crash. 

You must launch vanilla _Skyrim's_ launcher from _Steam_ at least once or _Wabbajack_ cannot detect it.

##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. 

This login can be found by clicking the gear icon in the top right.

##  Problems with Wabbajack

Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance.

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim, and this is not negotiable. 

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers hosting the list's files. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. 

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Licentia Black_ will not work with a GOG or pirated game version. If you own the game on _Steam,_ return to the Installation step. 

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple _Wabbajack_ lists. Sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.

## Post-Installation

### Verifying the Modlist

To verify the modlist, launch the _Wabbajack_ app again after installation.

Click the **VERIFY** button.

Wait for the process to complete. It can take quite some time.

### Launching the Modlist

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. 

Launch the game from the **SKSE** entry in the drop-down menu.
