# LICENTIA BLACK

![Licentia Black Logo](images/4k_licentia_logo.webp)

## "All I want to be is a badass comic book hottie who fucks and cuts heads."

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

_Licentia BLACK_ is one of _Wabbajack's_ oldest and most well-regarded adult modlists, featuring optional non-fetish content with the _OSuite_ series of _OSA / OStim_ mods and an emphasis on build variety, backed up by an accessible Power Fantasy design philosophy. It also includes a host of displayable collectibles in the form of the _Legacy of the Dragonborn_ museum, with patches to incorporate **every** LOTD Quest Mod and all but one of the "Super Follower" mods. In addition to all this, the author places great weight on ensuring the list is as stable as it can possibly be and aggressively removes mods which cause regular crashes, and recent improvements to the NSFW framework ensure that it is much more viable for a long-term playthrough. As the final bonus, additions and customizations are welcomed via the author's Discord server, so if you don't like the list, **MAKE IT YOUR OWN!!**

**ALTERNATE TESTING VERSIONS ARE AVAILABLE!** In [this document](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/licentia_black/blob/main/ALTERNATES.md) you will find many other versions of my list (because I have too much time on my hands), suitable for almost any style of play. Included are flashy combat animation versions, versions with skimpy outfits, versions with punishing survival mods, versions that have thousands more _LOTD_ displays, a _SexLab_ verson based on female submission, and a _Toys_ version which is the same, but wackier and more stable.

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)

# BEFORE YOU BEGIN! VERY IMPORTANT!

You will save yourself a **LOT** of headaches if you download all the _Lover's Lab_ files manually **BEFORE** you begin installing anything with _Wabbajack_. 

You will first need to wade through the [Lover's Lab website](https://www.loverslab.com) -- which features a cringey amount of porn ads. (I recommend an ad blocker.) Create an account with an email you don't care about, then use the registration process to confirm the account via an email you will receive. 

**You cannot avoid creating an account here.** If _Lover's Lab_ is blocked in your location, I recommend against going further, but there are ways around it...

After you confirm your account, login to _Lover's Lab._

Next, create a directory for your chosen modlist. I recommend something in the root folder of a fast Solid State Drive, or -- ideally -- an M.2 NVME. (Something like `D:\Licentia`). 

Within that directory, create another directory called `downloads` -- in all lower case. (`D:\Licentia\downloads`)

Now consult the below URL corresponding to your version of _Licentia_. Place all of the files in the `downloads` directory you created above. **DO NOT EXTRACT THEM.** _Wabbajack_ will take care of that.

**Return to this document when you have downloaded all the necessary files.**

_Licentia BLACK:_ There are very few _Lover's Lab_ downloads for these versions so you will probably not have problems. I will create a document for them anyway **SOON**(tm)

_Licentia MAX:_ Refer to the [Complete Alphabetical Lover's Lab Download Guide for Licentia Max.](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/licentia_black/blob/main/Complete-LL-Manual-Download-Guide.md)

## Installation

# DELETE SKYRIM.

**No, I'm not joking.** As of **12/6/2023** _Bethesda_ is in the process of updating almost every file included in the game on a piecemeal basis, and the methods I have been using for the past 24 hours to acquire the most updated versions have almost continously failed spectacularly. Rather than save yourself the headache of dozens of mismatching files, Steam verifications and re-downloads of the _Creation Club_ Content, I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** you completely delete your copy of _Skyrim Special Edition_ before installing my list. Just delete the directory where it is located in your Game Folder.

**Afterward,** you need to reacquire the most recent files from _Steam._ Right-click on the _Steam_ listing for "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim," select "Properties" and then the menu option on the left labeled "Installed files." In the middle somewhere will be a button that reads "Verify integrity of game files," click this and **wait for the verification process to complete in its entirety.**

Once that is done, you will need to purchase the _Skyrim Anniversary Edition Upgrade_ from _Steam_ if you have not done so already. **This is not optional.** This modlist will not function without it. I enjoy the CC Content and I have no desire to maintain double the number of Profiles so in order to play _Licentia_ you **must purchase it.**

First, ensure that you have purchased the _Anniversary Edition_ DLC from _Steam._ The cost is around $20 but you may be able to find it discounted elswhere. Once you have purchased it and it is showing up in your list of DLC for _Skyrim,_ (near the right hand side of the Library Page for the game) you can continue.

After that the process gets more involved. You will need to launch _Skyrim_ **FROM STEAM** without any mods to reach the Main Menu. The launcher will prompt you to detect settings, just click okay and go with whatever it suggests. Then click "PLAY." The game **SHOULD** thank you for purchasing the _Anniversary Edition Upgrade_ and prompt you to download it. **Do so.** 

If it does not, Click the **Creations** menu option along the bottom right. You will see _Skyrim's_ new interface for downloading mods directly from Bethesda. Click the **[O] OPTIONS** button at the bottom of the screen. A menu will appear from which you need to select **Download all owned Creation Club Creations.**

The download process for the _Anniversary Edition Upgrade Content_ will begin after this and takes about five minutes, you **CANNOT** ALT-TAB out of this or minimize or the downloads won't complete, so just be patient. Once all files are downloaded, the game will briefly reload to organize and activate them, and then you can close Vanilla Skyrim and continue the installation as described below.

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update _Skyrim_ for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), open the Properties window of _Skyrim AE_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_. It is incompatible with the profile-specific saves of a _Wabbajack_ modlist.

**Set the Game language to English**

_Wabbajack_ will check your game files and make sure that your installed version is the same as my installed version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation. You can change the game's language in the Properties window as mentioned above. It may be required to verify your files afterward.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory of one of your drives. (D:\ for example.)

**Do Not Use Any Protected Folders inside of OneDrive**

You will experience unusual behavior if your `My Games` folder (usually in the `Documents` folder) is part of a _OneDrive_ Cloud Folder. You will need to relocate it or disable _OneDrive._ There are no exceptions.

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. _Wabbajack_ and _Mod Organizer 2_ both use low-level file system virtualization which most anti-malware programs falsely detect as malicious. 

Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ don't propery respect exclusions and cannot be completely disabled -- they must be fully uninstalled. Please consider avoiding third-party anti-malware solutions and relying on _Windows Defender,_ which is more compatible with the applications used to install and play _Wabbajack_ modlists. 

**Set Pagefile to 40GB Or Above**

This can be accomplished in the System Settings for Windows. It is recommended to set the minimum and maximum pagefile size to `40,960` all on one solid state drive as mentioned above. More than one pagefile is not needed so long as it is large enough and located on a fast enough drive.

**Ensure Enough Free Storage Space**

As of this writing approximately **20GB** is required for the `Steam` folder, **180 GB** for the downloads folder, and **260 GB** for the modlist folder. Approximately **30 GB** of free space is required on your `Windows` drive and **30 GB** additional free space on your `Wabbajack` drive to leave room for temporary files, patches, and caches. Thus the total required space is approximately **520 GB.** These do not all need to be on the same drive.  Finally, never reduce the free space on any drive below **15%** (the bar in _File Manager_ will turn red) or you will suffer severe performance problems.
 
##  Using Wabbajack

The first step you need to do is login to [The Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com) with the **GEAR** icon in the top right of _Wabbajack._ (You have a _Nexus_ account, right?) You will find a login button there, it functions just like the normal _Nexus_ login page does, and the "toggle" will switch over to "logged in" when you are successful.

If you don't have _Nexus Premium_ you are probably going to wish for death before this process is over. None of the process will be automated, and you will have to click through hundreds of mod links and interstitial ads, all while enduring torturously slow max download speeds. Please, for your sanity and mine, get at least a month of _Premium._ The money you would save with a free account amounts to about three cents per hour of work clicking on links. You wouldn't take a job for three cents an hour would you? Why would you click on links for hours to save that much money?

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. 

It is advised to have ALL relevant folders (for `Wabbajack.exe`, `Steam`, the modlist folder, and the downloads folder) on a solid state drive. Do not place any of these folders on a hard disk drive, flash drive, or external drive of any kind. After the list is installed, you can relocate **only** the downloads folder to such a drive (or delete it, but that may make updating difficult).

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the bare minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**DO NOT CONTACT MOD AUTHORS DIRECTLY.**

I, cacophony, fully accept any responsibility for difficulties with this list and any conflicts I introduce, so please do not question mod authors on the _Nexus_, _Lover's Lab_, or any other site about bugs that may result from this lists' use. Direct your questions to me, not the innocent mod authors who should never be expected to support a modlist setup.

**Various files beginning with "cc" and ending with "esl" or "esm" failed to download.**

You did not purchase the $20 upgrade to Skyrim. This is not negotiable. Purchase it, verify it, delete it and re-download it if necessary, and try again.

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Try using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, you may need to delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Licentia Black_ will not work with a GOG or pirated version of the game. If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **DO NOT ASK FOR HELP WITH PIRATED GAMES.**

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple _Wabbajack_ lists. I can't support circumventing MEGA's bandwith restrictions so either sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.

## Post-Installation

### System Specifications

The list's performance requirements have been greatly increased, therefore, the recommended setup for an enjoyable experience **at 1080p** is at least

- intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 5600 or later
- NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER or AMD Radeon 5700 XT or later

The list is configured for 1440 by default because that's my monitor's native resolution. Higher resolutions demand more hardware. If you wish to change your game's resolution to your own native resolution for **BEST** quality, select the "INI Editor" from the _Tools_ menu along the icon bar of MO2 and change it via the `SkyrimPrefs.ini` file. Scroll down until you see the `[Display]` header and look for the `iSize` values. Note that the TYPICAL ORDER IS REVERSED, so for 1080p you would set the first value, `iSize H=` to **1080** and the second value, `iSize W=` to **1920.**

If you are confident you meet the above target, but still experience severe performance drops, you may need to customize your `BIOS` settings to maximize your hardware. Refer to your motherboard's documentation. You're generally looking to enable something called the "XMP" or "ACMOS" profiles, depending on your motherboard. If that still doesn't help, there is a guide to replace a few of the more demanding mods at the end of this document, under the "Modifying" header.

### Launching the List

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. Launch the game from the **SKSE** entry in the drop-down menu.

## MCM CONFIGURATION

## WHEN YOU SPAWN IN HELGEN'S INN, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait until all the messages appear then disappear in the upper left corner of the screen. Then you may continue.

## MCM Recorder

**_SERVITIUM_** _requires very specific, more complex configurations_ as well as a whole host of additional instructions and warnings. If you are playing one of these profiles in _Licentia MAX_, ignore the below paragraphs (until "Final Notes") and instead [read this](https://github.com/cacophony-wj/licentia_black/blob/main/Running-MCMs-For-Pitch-&-Dead.md).

Find the _MCM Recorder_ menu in the _Mod Configuration_ menu accessible via the `ESCAPE` key or the `START` button. Click the **"READ README THEN RUN ME"** recording, click OK, close the MCM menu, click the "Run Recording" button when it appears, and **TOUCH NOTHING.** Wait for a message to pop up saying playback is finished, then wait for all messages to disappear in the upper-left corner of your screen. There may occasionally be error messages referencing outdated settings. They are unimportant. Skip them.

Some users with weak CPU configurations may experience the MCM Recording "sticking" at about the "Genesis Unleashed" step. If this happens to you and no movement occurs after approximately 60 seconds, try exiting the starting room there before you run the recording. **NOTE:** This suggests to me that your CPU is rather weak for the VM load so you may have a bad time later on.

**OPTIONAL** If you prefer _futanari_ style content (look it up, I'm not describing it on _Github_), run the optional **"RUN TO ADD FUTA**" MCM Recording. This will give all females in the game a 10% chance to randomly get _The Touch._ This chance applies to the player as well. If you want to force _The Touch_ on yourself, you'll need to consult the _SOS_ MCM. I can't really go into details here.

Everything should now be configured automatically thanks to **NEW** MCM Recordings. Enjoy the modlist!

## FINAL NOTES

When you reach your first exterior world location, you will be prompted to enable _Survival Mode_. With this option enabled, you will not be able to fast travel normally, markers can be placed next to other markers, and you will have to eat food, sleep, and stay warm to survive. (Fast travel can, however, be enabled on _Survival Mode_ by consulting the _Conner's Survival Mode_ MCM.) You will also receive a prompt about which Divine and/or Daedra you wish to worship, depending on your race. Choose according to your preference.

## Updating the Modlist

Many times newer versions of _Licentia_ will require an updated version of _Wabbajack_. Please ensure that you run _only_ the `Wabbajack.exe` located in the root of the _Wabbajack_ directory. _Wabbajack_ will automatically update to the latest version if necessary. 

Download the modlist from the Gallery and specify the same directories. If you have customized the list, you can append `[NoDelete]` to the beginning of your added mods in _Mod Organizer 2_ and they will not be deleted. However, they will be unchecked and relocated to the bottom of the list of installed mods. You will need to return them to their rightful place and re-enable or rewrite any patches you created.

It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Licentia BLACK_ folder. 

## IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER PROBLEMS, PLEASE CONSULT THE TROUBLESHOOTING DOCUMENT.

Refer to [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). If you can't find your answer there, ensure that you have followed **EVERY STEP** of this readme to the letter. Often a reinstall of the list will solve many unusual problems. If your problem involves an inability to continue a mandatory portion of the game, refer to the _Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages_ and verify that you are not experiencing a vanilla bug. Try loading a save from before the most recent quest stage or dungeon that you started. 

Also at the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` document above, you can find tips for improving performance on weaker systems, as well as a quick and easy way to deck all the ladies of _Tamriel_ out in some sexy sloot and barely-there bikinis. Bonus topless art included!
