**Using A Controller - New and improved and updated for Licentia Black**

Controller mods are disabled by default. They can be found under "Controller Options", but serve no purpose so long as you use a mouse and keyboard. However, if you wish to play with a controller, you will have to enable all these mods and delete any `ControlMap_Custom` file(s) in your Licentia "Stock Game" folder install directory. If there is no such file in this directory, you do not need to worry about it. Just make certain one is not present. The Gamepad is also disabled in _Skyrim's_ default "Settings" menu, that option will need to be checked. 

You will have to configure _CGO_ (I recommend D-Pad Left for grip shift and LB for Dual-Wield Blocking), and _The Ultimate Dodge Mod_ (I recommend D-Pad Down for Sneak). You also may need to enable "Gamepad Compatibility" in the _Ultimate Dodge_ MCM or that mod may not function. There is no good button for Target Lock, I typically assign the same one as Dual-Wield Blocking (LB). Finally, reconfigure your QuickSave and QuickLoad keys in-game. You must ALSO recall that almost ALL OStim navigation can only be accomplished via the keyboard, so you will have to switch back and forth. When all is said and done the Gamepad controls will be as follows:

Start: Journal

Back: Wait

LT: Left Attack

RT: Right attack

LB+Back: Quicksave

RB+Start: Tween menu (character menu)

LB+RB: Shout (in that order, you kinda haveta roll your fingers across them)

LB: Lock-on (toggle), Dual-Wield Block

RB: Sprint

LS: Favorites

RS: Switch POV

A: Activate

B: Roll

X: Ready weapon

Y: Jump

D-Pad Down: Sneak / Stop Sneaking

D-Pad Left: Switch grip between 1-handed and 2-handed (CGO)

(Use the sticks to navigate menus instead!)
