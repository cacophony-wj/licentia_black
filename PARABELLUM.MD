## Preamble

**This modlist includes adult content. You must be of legal age in your country to use it (typically 18+ in most western countries, 21+ in some eastern countries).**

_Parabellum_ is an **NSFW** modlist for _Fallout 4_ that includes mods like _Sim Settlements 2, Native Animation Framework,_ and several quest mods.

_Parabellum NUKA_ is a focused **NSFW list** for the **_NUKA RIDE_** mod.

Both lists are rarely updated, if at all.

##  Using Wabbajack

Log in to [The Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com) using the **GEAR** icon at the top right of _Wabbajack._

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are many reasons _Wabbajack_ may produce errors. Try running _Wabbajack_ again before seeking solutions.

**Could not download x:**

Some internet providers may have trouble accessing the servers hosting the mod files. Try using a VPN with a server in the United States.

**_Wabbajack_ could not find the game folder:**

_Parabellum_ will not work with _GOG_ or pirated game versions. If using _Steam,_ return to the installation step.

**MEGA download cap exceeded:**

This error happens if downloading the list multiple times or downloading multiple _Wabbajack_ lists.

Sign up for a _MEGA_ account or wait for the timeout to reset.

## Post-Installation

### System Requirements

These mods require a system slightly more powerful than the original game. 

The CPU is more important than usual for most games.

## NEXT GEN UPDATE

All _Creation Club_ content added after the TV show is included by default.

Other _Creation Club_ content will likely work as optional additions. 

Copy the files to the correct directory before starting a new game.

### Launching the List

Open `ModOrganizer.exe` from the folder where the modlist was installed.

Launch the game through the **F4SE** option in the drop-down menu.

## MCM CONFIGURATION

Press the `Enter` key several times after selecting "New Game" to skip any hidden menu prompts.

### WHEN YOU SPAWN IN THE BATHROOM, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait five minutes. Time it.

To configure MCMs, press the ESC key and select "MOD CONFIG."

Find the bottom settings entry and press "Apply."

#### A Note on NSFW Content

Active Sex Hotkey: `F6`. This will allow flirting or offering to strip.

Passive Sex Hotkey: `F7`. This will offer sex work or surrender to an assault.

#### A Note About NUKA RIDE

Details about the main mod can be found [here](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/171006-aaf-nuka-ride-a-porn-studio-mod/).

When using this mod, there is little need to play the original game.

The author's _Patreon_ is linked at that page. Any donations for _NUKA_ should go to the author. They deserve the support.

## Updating the Modlist

Sometimes, newer versions of _Parabellum_ require an updated _Wabbajack_ version.

Download the new _Wabbajack,_ select "Install From Disk," and choose the same directories. Then check the "Overwrite" box.

It is usually not recommended to continue a save when updating a modlist.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Parabellum_ folder.
