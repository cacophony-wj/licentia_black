# PARABELLUM

![Parabellum Image](images/OIG1.png)

## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

_Parabellum_ was an NSFW Vanilla+ _Fallout 4_ modlist featuring _Sim Settlements 2,_ _Native Animation Framework_ and a pile of Quest mods.

_Parabellum NUKA_ was a tightly focused NSFW list for playing the _NUKA RIDE Fallout 4_ modification.

Both lists are currently on hiatus due to the author's health difficulties.

## Installation

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required. Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

Set the Game language to English

Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder

Do Not Use Any Protected Folders inside of OneDrive

Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs

Set Pagefile to 40GB Or Above

Ensure Enough Free Storage Space

Launch Fallout 4 Once Before You Continue
 
##  Using Wabbajack

The first step is to log in to [The Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com) with the **GEAR** icon at the top right of _Wabbajack._

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are many different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance.

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Try using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. 

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Parabellum_ will not work with a GOG or pirated game version. If you own the game on _Steam,_ return to the Installation step. 

**MEGA download cap exceeded.**

This shouldn't happen unless you download the list multiple times or download multiple _Wabbajack_ lists. Sign up for an account or wait for the timeout to expire.

## Post-Installation

### System Specifications

A little bit higher than the original game.

CPU is more important than with most videogames.

## NEXT GEN UPDATE

All _Creation Club_ content shoehorned in after the TV show is available by default.

Any other _Creation Club_ content will probably work in a modular fashion.

Copy it to the appropriate directory before you begin a New Game.

### Launching the List

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list.

 Launch the game from the **F4SE** entry in the drop-down menu.

## MCM CONFIGURATION

It may be necessary to press the `Enter` key a few times after you select "New Game" to skip some invisible menu prompts. 

### WHEN YOU SPAWN IN THE BATHROOM, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait five minutes. Time it.

To configure the MCMs, press the `ESC` key and select the top menu option: "MOD CONFIG."

Find the bottom Settings entry and press "Apply."

#### A bit of a Note on how to Engage with the NSFW Content

Active Sex Hotkey is F6. You will flirt with people or offer to strip.

Passive Sex Hotkey is F7. You will offer your services as a sex worker or surrender to an assault.

#### A Bit of a Note about NUKA RIDE

Look up the mod on _Lover's Lab._ 

Once you play this version there is not much point to the original game.

## Updating the Modlist

Many times newer versions of _Parabellum_ will require an updated version of _Wabbajack_. 

Download the new _Wabbajack_ file, select the "Install From Disk" option, and specify the same directories. Then check the "Overwrite" box. 

It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Parabellum_ folder.
