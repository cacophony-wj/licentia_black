# PARABELLUM

![Parabellum Image](images/OIG1.png)

## Preamble

**This modlist includes adult content. You must be of legal age in your country to use it (typically 18+ in most western countries, 21+ in some eastern countries).**

_Parabellum_ is an **NSFW** modlist for _Fallout 4_ that includes mods like _Sim Settlements 2, Native Animation Framework,_ and several quest mods.

_Parabellum NUKA_ is a focused **NSFW list** for the **_NUKA RIDE_** mod.

Both lists are rarely updated, if at all.

# IMPORTANT! BEFORE STARTING!

Manually download all the _Lover's Lab_ files before installing anything using _Wabbajack._

Save all the files in the `downloads` folder for your modlist.

## Installation

##  Using Wabbajack

Log in to [The Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com) using the **GEAR** icon at the top right of _Wabbajack._

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are many reasons _Wabbajack_ may produce errors. Try running _Wabbajack_ again before seeking solutions.

**Could not download x:**

Some internet providers may have trouble accessing the servers hosting the mod files. Try using a VPN with a server in the United States.

**_Wabbajack_ could not find the game folder:**

_Parabellum_ will not work with _GOG_ or pirated game versions. If using _Steam,_ return to the installation step.

**MEGA download cap exceeded:**

This error happens if downloading the list multiple times or downloading multiple _Wabbajack_ lists.

Sign up for a _MEGA_ account or wait for the timeout to reset.

## Post-Installation

### System Specifications

A little bit higher than the original game.

CPU is more important than with most videogames.

## NEXT GEN UPDATE

All _Creation Club_ content shoehorned in after the TV show is available by default.

Any other _Creation Club_ content will probably work in a modular fashion.

Copy it to the appropriate directory before you begin a New Game.

### Launching the List

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list.

 Launch the game from the **F4SE** entry in the drop-down menu.

## MCM CONFIGURATION

It may be necessary to press the `Enter` key a few times after you select "New Game" to skip some invisible menu prompts. 

### WHEN YOU SPAWN IN THE BATHROOM, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!

Wait five minutes. Time it.

To configure the MCMs, press the `ESC` key and select the top menu option: "MOD CONFIG."

Find the bottom Settings entry and press "Apply."

#### A bit of a Note on how to Engage with the NSFW Content

Active Sex Hotkey is F6. You will flirt with people or offer to strip.

Passive Sex Hotkey is F7. You will offer your services as a sex worker or surrender to an assault.

#### A Bit of a Note about NUKA RIDE

You can read details on the central mod (here)[https://www.loverslab.com/topic/171006-aaf-nuka-ride-a-porn-studio-mod/]

Once you play this version there is not much point to the original game.

The author's _Patreon_ is at that link. Any donations to me for _NUKA_ should go to them. They deserve the compensation.

## Updating the Modlist

Many times newer versions of _Parabellum_ will require an updated version of _Wabbajack_. 

Download the new _Wabbajack_ file, select the "Install From Disk" option, and specify the same directories. Then check the "Overwrite" box. 

It is rarely recommended to continue a save when you update a modlist.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Parabellum_ folder.
