- Tested _OBody Standalone_ as a solution for the _OBody_ updating bug ... no dice.

The main Male and Female folders are from official preset "mods" on Nexus. The User Submissions folder has presets from my user presets channel. (They are still very messy.) All sculpts can be found a couple directories above, in the Sculpts folder.
