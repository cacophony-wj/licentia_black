## LICENTIA 12.18

**A Bit of a Note About This Update**

I am sick of users dealing with animation bugs I can't replicate -- specifically, when the player gets "stuck" in crafting, sleeping, or _Animated Traversal_ animations. They can be resolved with the `player.moveto player` console command but for some they are so frequent as to make the list almost unplayable. My staff confirms that they do not manifest without _Improved Camera_, so that mod has been removed. You are just going to have to deal with the lack of a first person body and POV sex, not even returning _Improved Camera_ to its default configuration solved it.

There is also another change many of you will probably not enjoy. I am convinced that _SMP_ contributes a lot to other crashes some users experience. It's almost always somewhere in the log whenever a crash occurs. I find little value in _SMP,_ I don't turn it on for sex scenes and most of the physics are a joke. I don't know how many times I've seen a dead guy's cape flying up like a banner or my own hair twisting off into infinity when I change camera modes. The only time I do bother with it is if I want to strip down and walk slowly toward the camera for a few seconds to admire the jiggle. So, I'm going to try without it for awhile. I believe the list will be more playable but you be the judge.

I should probably remove _DynDOLOD NG_ as well, since the crash on multiple load bug doesn't appear to be resolved, but that requires hours of regenerating LODs, so I settled for Updating the DLL instead. Maybe it'll make a difference, maybe it won't. I rarely if ever had any of the problems mentioned.

Lastly I finally corrected the darkface on Vilja and a couple of Bruma border guards properly.

All sculpts can be found a couple directories above, in the Sculpts folder.
